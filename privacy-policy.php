                    We are committed to protecting our customers privacy in every way we can. This page details everything we do that may be concerning, including things we do that you may not be aware of.

                    Information Security
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most important ways to protect your privacy is to know very little about you. We store the least amount of personally identifiable information we can, reducing the ability for your information to be compromised should we ever run into security problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Data Retention
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As part of our commitment to protecting your privacy, upon the expiration of your services with us all stored content will be instantly and irrecoverably destroyed. There are two cases where your data will be retained longer: If you have indicated to us that there is a complication in your payment, we will retain your data beyond the expiration while you resolve the payment difficulties. If your services expire without indication that you are canceling we will retain your data for an additional 2 days, allowing you an opportunity to renew before permanent deletion.
                </p>
                <h2>Information Disclosure</h2>
                <p>We will never provide information we have on you to any third party.</p>
                <h2>Request Transparency</h2>
                <p>It is our prerogative to be transparent about information requests with you. In the event of a third party or Government requesting any information regarding you or your activity, to notify you immediately. The only exception to this is if a valid Indian Government Gag order is included.
                </p>
                <h2>Account Deletion</h2>
                <p>
                    Due to legal obligations in maintaining the accuracy of historical invoices, even if you were to delete your account, the majority of the information we store would need to be preserved within those historical records. As such, we do not allow account deletion.
